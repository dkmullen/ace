  <p class="reference">
      <span class="accent-text">*</span>4 individuals could form 4 different teams, but they must each perform
      a different category for each team. For example - a musical theatre performer would only be allowed
      to be on one team. If he/she entered on another team, it would have to be under a different category.
      An individual competing for a TEAM is welcome to audition for any and all other categories as an individual, but he/she may only perform on one TEAM per category.
