    <div class="bold accent-text">Why My Generation’s Music is Worth a Listen</div>
    <p>by Isabella Francisco</p>
    <p>April 29, 2020</p>
    <div class="left-justify">
    <p>Listening to music for pleasure is like opening a cascade of emotions that feel so new and yet so familiar at the same time. Everyone has a music taste, and many existing factors can develop or change an individual’s taste in music. There are millions of songs for anything imaginable, such as heartbreak, depression, joy, love, and many others. Music is a beautiful thing and listening to music from different periods gives a taste of what it was like for the people living in those days. Nowadays, music is more based on emotional relatability, one person’s message of their hardships could become another’s support during challenging times. The music of Generation Z is worth a listen by the others outside of it.</p>
    <p>Generation Z’s music focuses on relatability and emotions that the listener can understand and apply to themselves. “Say Something” written by Christina Aguilera, does not tell a specific story of a person or event, but its lyrics are much broader, therefore being more relatable to a diverse audience. The chorus of this song recites, “Say something, I'm giving up on you. I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you. Anywhere, I would've followed you. Say something, I'm giving up on you”. This can easily be applied to many situations, such as the loss of a family member, experiencing a breakup with a significant other, or the struggle of having a suicidal friend. “Jamais Vu” by BTS (Bangtan Boys) expresses the pain that comes with regret. This song digs deeper into the emotions of the listener and manages to put an indescribable burden into words for millions to relate to. Generation Z has the highest suicide rates in history, and these rates are only going up. The main cause for this is none other than social media platforms. There is a deep pain that comes with seeing others and feeling worthless in comparison, feeling alone. Being able to relate to music gives a feeling of comfort, knowing more people are struggling with the same thing.</p>
    <p>Generation Z is known to have exceedingly diverse and artistic music consumption habits. The uniqueness of each individual’s playlist is like a person’s fingerprint. In a recent study done by Brittany Hodak, she discovered that nearly 97% of Generation Z listens to at least five different musical genres regularly (Hodak). Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Wynton Marsalis once expressed, “For years of teaching in the country, and reading criticism in books, I feel like the things most needed in our culture are the understanding of the meanings of our music. We haven’t done that good of a job teaching our kids what our music means or how we developed our taste in music that reminds us and teaches us who we are”. Generation Z does not just listen to music as a hobby, it is a means of expressing individual personality and teaches people more about themselves. Teenage singer Billie Eilish was recently thrust into fame after her first original song “Ocean Eyes” became a worldwide sensation at the age of fourteen. She only intended for one person to hear it, her dance teacher, but that was surely not the case. A young girl, writing lyrics purely to express herself, had her life changed after half the globe heard her song. The music of Generation Z consists of a diverse range of styles to listen to.</p>
    <p>Individuals who are not willing to explore Generation Z’s music would argue that they already have an established music taste. Opponents on the subject wonder why exploring new music is beneficial when already satisfied with a specific style or era. It is understandable that people have solidified music preferences and would like to stick to the same styles they have always liked, but the people who make these points have not experienced the joy and excitement of discovering new music. Generation Z’s music is worth a listen from those of other generations. It is possible to find that a fresh style of music is incredible, but without trying it and being willing to accept change, it is impossible to open the door to a world of undiscovered artistic beauty. A change in culture, or a circumstance that left an impression on the person, are both likely factors to a change in music taste. Without experiencing the brilliance of Generation Z’s music, an accurate opinion cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is valid that Generation Z’s music is worth a listen.</p>
    <p>	It is worth it for individuals of other generations to explore the wonders of Generation Z’s music. Because of the complexity of modern-day teenagers’ emotions and mental health, the music of their generation is extremely deep and meaningful. People of other generations should give the music of Generation Z a listen to discover beautifully expressive pieces of musical art. Generation Z teens may face more emotional chaos and mental health issues than any other, but as a whole, they are strong, their music uplifts them and tells them they are valuable. The impact their music has on them must be shared with more than the small confinement of one generation…but with the world.</p>
