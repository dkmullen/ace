<div class="bold accent-text">A Voice of a Generation</div>
<p>by Elizabeth Newman</p>
<p>April 29, 2020</p>

<div class="left-justify">
<p>The world is a myriad of emotions, colors, and ideas; everything has its own sound. Imagine the joy of a dream coming true, the love of falling for someone, the crippling pain that leaves you sagging against the door after a breakup, or even the anger at the betrayal of a friend. Situations like these have inspired artists from all different generations; each generation has its own take and depth to these emotions. This is where I believe our generation shines in music, the depth and freedom they use. Why listen to our generation’s music? There are two main reasons: experience and risk. Both reasons give any genre of music you listen to an edge and life that is difficult to find.</p>
<p class="bold">“When someone asks you to listen to a song, it’s because the lyrics mean everything they are trying to say.” <span class="accent-text">Unknown</span></p>
<p>Experience is often the first step to creating any music and it is the first reason why our generation stands out. This is the reason many of us have the favorite song that we do; whether the experience is a memory that you associate with the song or the connection of artist and their music, we all connect with music. Ever have a song reach out to you, hit you in your emotions and makes you live in the moment? This is the connection we all share with music. Musicians use what they have lived through to get across ideas, stories, and lessons. They use these experiences that we have all lived through to connect us all through song, whether it’s a Christian song that shares of someone who was  saved by God, an Indie Pop song about heartbreak, or a Country song about living life to the fullest. This generation uses most songs to have a purpose; they are either to have you make a moment or relive one in a whole new way. Our music is to give you an experience with every word. This experience can be jamming out to a song in the middle of a party being utterly happy, having a song to just cry over when you need it, or having a song that talks about the same problems you are facing. Using this, today’s artists can reach out to their audience and make them feel. It brings life to their music. The only thing the artist needs is the courage to take the risk of writing their song.</p>
<p class="bold">“Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” <span class="accent-text">T.S. Elliot</span> </p>
<p>The second aspect that makes this generation shine is risk. Nowadays, there are so many artists that have become big because of what they say with their music instead of their music only being popular because of them. For example, many rappers now are often known because of what they say in their ‘par’ and not the fact that they can rap. One example of this is an artist known as NF. NF often uses his own traumas or thoughts to connect to others. His song, “Change” shows this when he uses his thoughts and experiences to prove his want to change his life. This connects to listeners that feel trapped as he does in a box of their own creating that they want to break free but resent pushing. Many creators are like NF, using their own emotions to reach out. This is where this risk in creating comes in. There is always a chance of being judged for your thoughts or that no one feels the same making you feel even more isolated. Today, many see that leap and take it anyway. Our generation stands out by the risks they take. Often, it then reflects in their music and the response. Feeling the fear that comes with that risk also humanizes the artist; the best songs are often the more human ones that feel as though they were written for you. Risk and experience often go hand in hand; an artist has an experience then takes the risk in sharing it.</p>
<p>What does experience and risk have to do with why someone should listen to this generation? We want to be heard. This generation is full of artists that speak out on all different branches of subjects. Lyrics goes from global warming to treating people correctly to seeing everyone the same. Stories are made of bullies to being saved to sharing God’s love. The artist is not judged by age, race, or gender. Today, people only care about what you say. Therefore, experience and risk mean so much today. People have so many experiences; however, rarely is anyone ever truly alone in this. Music combines us and helps us grow together. Today, it’s a language people use to speak to each other when speaking fails, “Lyrics mean everything they are trying to say.” Artists also take the risk in sharing these opinions. There is always a risk with putting your work out there. This generation, however, seems to not fear it. They use their words to speak over politics, environments, and even pandemics. People create ways to study, help others learn, and to educate all.  Music helps us reach out where our hands cannot; it helps us hear when there is only silence. Today, music is not seen as only art but as a way of life.</p>
<p>Music is a large wave that connects all of us; it proves that we all aren’t as different as we think we are. We all experience the world in similar and completely different ways; yet, we all feel. This generation of musicians shows experience and feeling through their music and then takes a risk in sharing it with the world. This makes this generation stand out with bigger ideas, thoughts, and feelings that they share with the world. Their music makes the world come to life with feeling and meaning. The only thing you are left to do is take a risk and experience what they have to say.</p>
