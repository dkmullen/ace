    <p>
        All participating students must be of high school grade level or below to participate 
        (college contests coming soon). 
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Submit your audition videos (preferably YouTube video links) and information using 
        our <span class="accent-text bold pointer underline" [routerLink]="['/national/signup']">sign-up 
        form</span> by deadlines above. Please make sure the videos are of good quality.  -->
        If you need more information, please contact <a href="mailto:jay@aceknox.com">jay@aceknox.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We ask that all performances are newly recorded and not from a recorded stage version 
        of a previous performance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">Musical Theatre</span> - all songs must be from previously produced material. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">Monologues</span> - we would prefer modern monologues (we will be holding 
        a Shakespeare contest later in the school year). We would also prefer that your monologue comes 
        from a play and not a free-standing piece. 
    </p>
