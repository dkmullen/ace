    <div class="event_secondary-heading bold">Details</div>
    <p>
        All participating students must be of high school grade level or below to participate (college contests coming soon). 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <p>
        All videos must be submitted to jay@aceknox.com by deadlines above. Preferably YouTube video links, but please make sure the videos are of good quality. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>
        We ask that all performances are newly recorded and not from a recorded stage version of a previous performance. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">Musical Theatre</span> - all songs must be from previously produced material. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>
        <span class="bold">Monologues</span> - we would prefer modern monologues (we will be holding a Shakespeare contest later in the school year). We would also prefer that your monologue comes from a play and not a free-standing piece. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>
        *If you need help finding a monologue or musical theatre song, or if you are interested in coaching for your piece, ACE has an available team of professional coaches. Please contact jay@aceknox.com for guidance. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <p>
        *The judging will take place from a national panel of judges representing Broadway houses, theatre companies, undergraduate and graduate theatre programs, and professional acting coaches unaffiliated with ACE. We guarantee you will get an honest and fair judging of your work. 
    </p>
