    <li>Dramatic Monologue</li>
    <li>Comedic Monologue</li>
    <li>Shakespeare Monologue</li>
    <li>Musical Theatre Song</li>
    <li><strong>*NEW* - TEAM Category</strong></li>

  <div class="event_section-header">Individual Competition:</div>
  <p>All individuals can compete in any and all categories. To audition, you must have a monologue
      or song that qualifies for the category.</p>
  <p>Four (4) Finalists will be picked to perform in each monologue category.</p>
  <p>We may have more finalists for the Musical Theatre Category.</p>

  <div class="event_section-header">Team Competition:</div>
  <p>Any school may enter the TEAM competition by putting together 4 individuals for each category
      to compete as a team. These individuals will automatically be entered into the individual
      categories as well. A school may have as many teams as they would like, but an individual
      cannot perform in the same team category twice.<span class="accent-text">*</span></p>
  <p>Three teams will be picked as finalists.</p>

  <div class="spacer"></div>
  <p class="reference">
      <span class="accent-text">*</span>4 individuals could form 4 different teams, but they must each perform
      a different category for each team. For example - a musical theatre performer would only be allowed
      to be on one team. If he/she entered on another team, it would have to be under a different category.
      An individual competing for a TEAM is welcome to audition for any and all other categories as an individual, but he/she may only perform on one TEAM per category.
