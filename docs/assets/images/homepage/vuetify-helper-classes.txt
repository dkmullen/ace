Vuetify helper classes

m = margin
p = padding

mt = margin top - could also choose (b, l, r, x (for left and right [x axis]), y (for top and bottom), or a for all

numbers(1 - 12) - Each number cooresponds to a four-px increment, so...

class="pa-4" = 16px of padding all around
class="mx-8 = margin-left and right of 32px;

Negative margin like this: class="ml-n12"
Auto margin: class="mx-auto"

xs	< 600px
sm	600px > < 960px
md	960px > < 1264px*
lg	1264px > < 1904px*
xl	> 1904px*
