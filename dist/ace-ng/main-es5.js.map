Everyone has a music taste, and many existing factors can develop or change an individual’s taste in music. There are millions of songs for anything imaginable, such as heartbreak, depression, joy, love, and many others. Music is a beautiful thing and listening to music from different periods gives a taste of what it was like for the people living in those days. Nowadays, music is more based on emotional relatability, one person’s message of their hardships could become another’s support during challenging times. The music of Generation Z is worth a listen by the others outside of it.</p>\n    <p>Generation Z’s music focuses on relatability and emotions that the listener can understand and apply to themselves. “Say Something” written by Christina Aguilera, does not tell a specific story of a person or event, but its lyrics are much broader, therefore being more relatable to a diverse audience. The chorus of this song recites, “Say something, I'm giving up on you. I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you. Anywhere, I would've followed you. Say something, I'm giving up on you”. This can easily be applied to many situations, such as the loss of a family member, experiencing a breakup with a significant other, or the struggle of having a suicidal friend. “Jamais Vu” by BTS (Bangtan Boys) expresses the pain that comes with regret. This song digs deeper into the emotions of the listener and manages to put an indescribable burden into words for millions to relate to. Generation Z has the highest suicide rates in history, and these rates are only going up. The main cause for this is none other than social media platforms. There is a deep pain that comes with seeing others and feeling worthless in comparison, feeling alone. Being able to relate to music gives a feeling of comfort, knowing more people are struggling with the same thing.</p>\n    <p>Generation Z is known to have exceedingly diverse and artistic music consumption habits. The uniqueness of each individual’s playlist is like a person’s fingerprint. In a recent study done by Brittany Hodak, she discovered that nearly 97% of Generation Z listens to at least five different musical genres regularly (Hodak). Grammy Award-winning trumpeter Wynton Marsalis once expressed, “For years of teaching in the country, and reading criticism in books, I feel like the things most needed in our culture are the understanding of the meanings of our music. We haven’t done that good of a job teaching our kids what our music means or how we developed our taste in music that reminds us and teaches us who we are”. Generation Z does not just listen to music as a hobby, it is a means of expressing individual personality and teaches people more about themselves. Teenage singer Billie Eilish was recently thrust into fame after her first original song “Ocean Eyes” became a worldwide sensation at the age of fourteen. She only intended for one person to hear it, her dance teacher, but that was surely not the case. A young girl, writing lyrics purely to express herself, had her life changed after half the globe heard her song. The music of Generation Z consists of a diverse range of styles to listen to.</p>\n    <p>Individuals who are not willing to explore Generation Z’s music would argue that they already have an established music taste. Opponents on the subject wonder why exploring new music is beneficial when already satisfied with a specific style or era. It is understandable that people have solidified music preferences and would like to stick to the same styles they have always liked, but the people who make these points have not experienced the joy and excitement of discovering new music. Generation Z’s music is worth a listen from those of other generations. It is possible to find that a fresh style of music is incredible, but without trying it and being willing to accept change, it is impossible to open the door to a world of undiscovered artistic beauty. A change in culture, or a circumstance that left an impression on the person, are both likely factors to a change in music taste. Without experiencing the brilliance of Generation Z’s music, an accurate opinion cannot be concluded. Therefore, it is valid that Generation Z’s music is worth a listen.</p>\n    <p>\tIt is worth it for individuals of other generations to explore the wonders of Generation Z’s music. Because of the complexity of modern-day teenagers’ emotions and mental health, the music of their generation is extremely deep and meaningful. People of other generations should give the music of Generation Z a listen to discover beautifully expressive pieces of musical art. Generation Z teens may face more emotional chaos and mental health issues than any other, but as a whole, they are strong, their music uplifts them and tells them they are valuable. The impact their music has on them must be shared with more than the small confinement of one generation…but with the world.</p>\n</div>\n    <div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"smaller-text\">\n    <p>Works cited:</p>\n    <p>Hodak, Brittany. “New Study Spotlights Gen Z’s Unique Music Consumption Habits.” <br /> \n        <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2018/03/06/new-study-spotlights-gen-zs-unique-music-consumption-habits/#1454a21942d0\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes Magazine, 7 Mar. 2018</a></p>\n</div>\n\n</div>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-acting-gallery',\n  templateUrl: './acting-gallery.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./acting-gallery.component.scss']\n})\nexport class ActingGalleryComponent implements OnInit {\n  pics = [];\n  picsCol2 = [];\n  picsCol3 = [];\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    for (let i = 1;

everything has its own sound. Imagine the joy of a dream coming true, the love of falling for someone, the crippling pain that leaves you sagging against the door after a breakup, or even the anger at the betrayal of a friend. Situations like these have inspired artists from all different generations; each generation has its own take and depth to these emotions. This is where I believe our generation shines in music, the depth and freedom they use. Why listen to our generation’s music? There are two main reasons: experience and risk. Both reasons give any genre of music you listen to an edge and life that is difficult to find.</p>\n<p class=\"bold\">“When someone asks you to listen to a song, it’s because the lyrics mean everything they are trying to say.” <span class=\"accent-text\">Unknown</span></p>\n<p>Experience is often the first step to creating any music and it is the first reason why our generation stands out. This is the reason many of us have the favorite song that we do; whether the experience is a memory that you associate with the song or the connection of artist and their music, we all connect with music. Ever have a song reach out to you, hit you in your emotions and makes you live in the moment? This is the connection we all share with music. Musicians use what they have lived through to get across ideas, stories, and lessons. They use these experiences that we have all lived through to connect us all through song, whether it’s a Christian song that shares of someone who was  saved by God, an Indie Pop song about heartbreak, or a Country song about living life to the fullest. This generation uses most songs to have a purpose; they are either to have you make a moment or relive one in a whole new way. Our music is to give you an experience with every word. This experience can be jamming out to a song in the middle of a party being utterly happy, having a song to just cry over when you need it, or having a song that talks about the same problems you are facing. Using this, today’s artists can reach out to their audience and make them feel. It brings life to their music. The only thing the artist needs is the courage to take the risk of writing their song.</p>\n<p class=\"bold\">“Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.” <span class=\"accent-text\">T.S. Elliot</span> </p>\n<p>The second aspect that makes this generation shine is risk. Nowadays, there are so many artists that have become big because of what they say with their music instead of their music only being popular because of them. For example, many rappers now are often known because of what they say in their ‘par’ and not the fact that they can rap. One example of this is an artist known as NF. NF often uses his own traumas or thoughts to connect to others. His song, “Change” shows this when he uses his thoughts and experiences to prove his want to change his life. This connects to listeners that feel trapped as he does in a box of their own creating that they want to break free but resent pushing. Many creators are like NF, using their own emotions to reach out. This is where this risk in creating comes in. There is always a chance of being judged for your thoughts or that no one feels the same making you feel even more isolated. Today, many see that leap and take it anyway. Our generation stands out by the risks they take. Often, it then reflects in their music and the response. Feeling the fear that comes with that risk also humanizes the artist; the best songs are often the more human ones that feel as though they were written for you. Risk and experience often go hand in hand; an artist has an experience then takes the risk in sharing it.</p>\n<p>What does experience and risk have to do with why someone should listen to this generation? We want to be heard. This generation is full of artists that speak out on all different branches of subjects. Lyrics goes from global warming to treating people correctly to seeing everyone the same. Stories are made of bullies to being saved to sharing God’s love. The artist is not judged by age, race, or gender. Today, people only care about what you say. Therefore, experience and risk mean so much today. People have so many experiences; however, rarely is anyone ever truly alone in this. Music combines us and helps us grow together. Today, it’s a language people use to speak to each other when speaking fails, “Lyrics mean everything they are trying to say.” Artists also take the risk in sharing these opinions. There is always a risk with putting your work out there. This generation, however, seems to not fear it. They use their words to speak over politics, environments, and even pandemics. People create ways to study, help others learn, and to educate all.  Music helps us reach out where our hands cannot; it helps us hear when there is only silence. Today, music is not seen as only art but as a way of life.</p>\n<p>Music is a large wave that connects all of us; it proves that we all aren’t as different as we think we are. We all experience the world in similar and completely different ways; yet, we all feel. This generation of musicians shows experience and feeling through their music and then takes a risk in sharing it with the world. This makes this generation stand out with bigger ideas, thoughts, and feelings that they share with the world. Their music makes the world come to life with feeling and meaning. The only thing you are left to do is take a risk and experience what they have to say.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"></div>\n\n</div>\n\n","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-photography',\n  templateUrl: './photography.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['../saferathome.scss']\n})\nexport class PhotographyComponent implements OnInit {\n  picArray = [];\n\n  constructor() { }\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    this.shuffleArray([\n      {name: 'Leah Kahre', id: 'leah'},\n      {name: 'Sydney Feistner', id: 'sydney'},\n      {name: 'Ella Pinchok', id: 'ella'},\n      {name: 'Isabella Murrell', id: 'isabella'},\n      {name: 'Elizabeth Newman', id: 'elizabeth'}\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  shuffleArray(array) {\n    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {\n      const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));\n      [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];\n    }\n    this.picArray = array;\n\n  }\n\n  scrollToElement(element): void {\n    const elem = document.getElementById(element);\n    console.log(element);\n    elem.scrollIntoView({behavior: \"smooth\", block: \"start\", inline: \"nearest\"});\n  }\n\n}\n","<div class=\"event_page-wrapper-photos\">\n    <div class=\"text-wrapper\">\n    <div class=\"event_secondary-heading\">ACE <span class=\"accent-text\">Safer@Home</span> Photography Contest</div> \n    <p [style.margin-bottom.px]=\"20\" class=\"announcement\">\n      For students through grade 12 in Knox County, Tennessee and surrounding counties. \n    </p>\n    <!-- <div>\n        <img src=\"assets/images/safe@home2020/photography.jpg\" alt=\"Woman photographing cherry blossoms\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"photo-credit\">Photo by kazuend on Unsplash</div> -->\n\n    <div class=\"smaller-text\">The theme: How has being out of school changed your life the most?
